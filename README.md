### **_Description_**

#### This is a browser game written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It was made because my kids saw me writing a Tic-Tac-Toe browswer game as an assignment for my software engineering bootcamp, and they asked me to make them a game. Our family loves reading and writing, so this was an easy and fun project for me to fit in between homework and projects.

### **_Technologies Used_**

- JavaScript
- CSS
